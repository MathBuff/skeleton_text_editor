Just as a matter of fact, you cannot use modules in a plain HTML page.
you have to use a server in order to get over a bunch of dumb security messages.
I have a python script that runs a server in console to deliver the HTML page to the
browser window.

To run the program, you run the python script when your terminal is in the current directory with:

python3 serve_https.py
