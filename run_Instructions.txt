Just as a matter of fact, you cannot use modules in a plain HTML page.
you have to use a server in order to get over a bunch of dumb security messages.
I have a python script that runs a server in console to deliver the HTML page to the
browser window.

with your terminal is in the current directory

To run the program, give permissions to the python script to run:
chmod +x serve_https.py

Then you run the python script with:

python3 serve_https.py
